I built this website without when I was starting with web development (*I'm still on it*), however I've learned new concepts such as Oriented Object 
Programing and gained experience that I'd like to apply on this old project of mine. I want to dominate Tailwind framework as well,so this is a good
opportunity to implement all those things and check how I can make my code a little bit better. 

1. I think it's a good idea to change the folder structure. I found a new one that I consider is better aligned with industry good practices.
2. I have to think how I'm going to modularize the Javascript files, so I follow as much as possible the SOLID principles.
